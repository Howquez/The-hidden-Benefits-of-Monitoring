# R Scripts

To reproduce my analysis you have to run the scripts listed here in the following order:
1. [Create your working directory](https://github.com/Howquez/The-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/R_Scripts/00_YourWorkingDirectory.R)
    1. Run the script first
    2. Download the data and scripts
    3. Store the data in the "01_Raw_Data" folder
    4. Store the R scripts in the "03_RCodes" folder
    5. Take a look into the scripts and adjust the wd path wherever necessary
2. [Read the raw data](https://github.com/Howquez/The-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/R_Scripts/01_Read_XML_Data.R)
3. [Manipulate the data](https://github.com/Howquez/The-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/R_Scripts/02_Data_Manipulation.R)
4. [Run the analysis](https://github.com/Howquez/The-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/R_Scripts/03_Data_Analysis.R)
5. [Visualize the data](https://github.com/Howquez/The-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/R_Scripts/04_Graphs&Tables.R)
    * You can find plots stemming from this file (using simulated data) [here](https://github.com/Howquez/The-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/Figures)
Other scripts, such as [WriteDataBase]https://github.com/Howquez/The-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/R_Scripts/Write_DataBase.R were used for different purposes and are not part of the anaylysis. I nevertheless uploaded them because they might help to replicate the experiment.
